## In which context did I this project?

This is my main personal project: as I love the world of cinema, videos, actors and creators, I embarked on this project in order to be able to help them.

## The goal of the project

The aim of this project is to develop a live-streaming platform in the image of Twitch or YouTube Gaming. I would like to be able to help streamers and especially the creators of original content, such as mini-series, by putting their content in the spotlight. I also want to highlight small creators, some of whom certainly deserve more viewers by creating a special points system in place.

This project will be divided into several sub-projects, of which the main one (Weam) is the livestreaming platform. Harmony, the sub-project is under development, but shhhh it's secret :no_mouth:  

Features never seen before will be present :eyes:

## Installation

This is a node.js chat application powered by SockJS and Express that provides the main functions you'd expect from a chat, such as emojis, private messages, an admin system, etc.
